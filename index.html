                            The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco, California. The band
                            consists
                            a
                            dynamic lineup featuring two lead vocalists, two guitarists,
                            a bassist, a keyboardist and a drummer. The band achieved its
                            first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention
                            from their future manager. Having extensive experience working
                            with both new and seasoned acts, the manager was confident the
                            band could succeed even further with more support, pushing
                            The Bees Knees to sign with a well known record label.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            From there, the band has soared, gaining international
                            recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts.
                            New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original
                            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of
                            the hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century.
                            Fans affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and
                            are drawn to their candid and authentic performances
                            on stage. The Bees Knees are currently recording their
                            second studio album, looking to be released in early 2024.
